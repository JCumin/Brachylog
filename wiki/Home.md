#Welcome to the Brachylog Wiki!

**Brachylog** is a declarative logic programming language much like Prolog. Brachylog is designed to be much terser than Prolog.

The name *Brachylog* is constituted of the prefix *brachy-* (meaning short, from Ancient Greek βραχύς) and the suffix *-log*, to denote its goal of being a terse version of Prolog.

This wiki aims at explaining the syntax and how to use Brachylog as a programming language. However, it does not really aim at explaining declarative logic programming or Prolog (which Brachylog ressembles closely), the basics of which are assumed to be known by the reader.
