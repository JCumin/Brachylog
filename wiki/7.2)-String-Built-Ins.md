#String Built-Ins

All string built-ins begin with a `@`.

##Variables

All string variables built-ins are composed of one `@` and an uppercase letter.

|Symbol|Name|                                           Value|
|:----:|:--------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `@A` | Alphabet | `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`
| `@B` |  | 
| `@C` | Consonants | `"bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"`
| `@D` | Consonants Variant | `"bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz"` (no `y`)
| `@E` |  | 
| `@F` |  | 
| `@G` |  | 
| `@H` | Hello, World! | `"Hello, World!"`
| `@I` | Integers | `"0123456789"`
| `@J` |  | 
| `@K` |  | 
| `@L` |  | 
| `@M` |  | 
| `@N` | Line Break | `\n`
| `@O` |  | 
| `@P` | Printable ASCII | ``" !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~"``. The first character is a space (here, it's an unbreakable space to avoid Markdown formatting issues).
| `@Q` | Quine | `"@Qw"` (Therefore, the program `@Qw` prints its own source code)
| `@R` |  | 
| `@S` | Space | `" "`
| `@T` | Tab | `"\t"`
| `@U` |  | 
| `@V` | Vowels | `"aeiou"`
| `@W` | Vowels Variant | `"aeiouy"`
| `@X` |  | 
| `@Y` |  | 
| `@Z` | Reversed Alphabet | `"zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"`

##Predicates

All string predicates start with `@`

|Symbol|Name|                                           Value|
|:----:|:--------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `@a` |  | 
| `@b` | Blocks | Unifies `.` with a list of elements which when concatenated result in `?`, and where all elements of those elements are the same.
| `@c` | To codes | Unifies `.` with a list of integers representing the code of each character of `?`.
| `@d` |  | 
| `@e` | Elements | Unifies `.` with the list of all elements of `?`. If `?` is already a list, it will vectorize to unify each element of `.` with the list of elements of each element of `?`, recursively.
| `@f` |  | 
| `@g` |  | 
| `@h` |  | 
| `@i` |  | 
| `@j` |  | 
| `@k` |  | 
| `@l` | Lowercase | Unifies `.` with the lowercase version of `?`
| `@m` |  | 
| `@n` | Split Lines | `.` is a list of strings which when concatenated with the separator `\n` result in `?`.
| `@o` |  | 
| `@p` | Pad | Each element of `.` is the corresponding element of `?` with spaces appended at the end such that all elements of `.` have the length of the longest string in `?`.
| `@q` |  | 
| `@r` |  | 
| `@s` |  | 
| `@t` |  | 
| `@u` | Uppercase | Unifies `.` with the uppercase version of `?`
| `@v` |  | 
| `@w` | Writeln | Write/format things to `STDOUT` exactly like `w`, but a line break is written after it.
| `@x` |  | 
| `@y` |  | 
| `@z` |  | 
| `@0` |  | 
| `@1` | Nchotomize | `? = [X:N]` or `? = [X1:…:XI:N]`. `.` is a list of `N` elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `X` (or `[X1:…:XI]`). If the length of `X/[X1:…:XI]` is not divisible by `N`, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@2` | Dichotomize | `.` is a list of 2 elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `?`. If the length of `?` is not divisible by 2, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@3` | Trichotomize | `.` is a list of 3 elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `?`. If the length of `?` is not divisible by 3, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@4` | Tetrachotomize | `.` is a list of 4 elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `?`. If the length of `?` is not divisible by 4, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@5` | Pentachotomize | `.` is a list of 5 elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `?`. If the length of `?` is not divisible by 5, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@6` | Hexachotomize | `.` is a list of 6 elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `?`. If the length of `?` is not divisible by 6, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@7` | Heptachotomize | `.` is a list of 7 elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `?`. If the length of `?` is not divisible by 7, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@8` | Octachotomize | `.` is a list of 8 elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `?`. If the length of `?` is not divisible by 8, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@9` | Enneachotomize | `.` is a list of 9 elements of same length, which when concatenated result in `?`. If the length of `?` is not divisible by 9, then the last element will be bigger/smaller than the rest.
| `@+` |  | 
| `@-` |  | 
| `@*` |  | 
| `@/` |  | 
| `@\` |  |
| `@^` |  | 
| `@%` |  | 
| `@=` |  | 
| `@<` |  | 
| `@>` |  | 
| `@(` |  | 
| `@)` |  | 
| `@[` | Prefix | Unifies `.` with a prefix of `?`, e.g. `[1:2:3]` is a prefix of `[1:2:3:4:5]`. This is not true for the empty list/string/leading `0`.
| `@]` | Suffix | Unifies `.` with a suffix of `?`, e.g. `[3:4:5]` is a suffix of `[1:2:3:4:5]`. This is not true for the empty list/string.
| `@{` |  | 
| `@}` |  | 
| `@,` |  | 
| `@;` |  | 
| `@:` |  |
| `@?` | Random element | Unifies `.` with a random element in `?`.
| `@.` |  | 
| `@!` |  | 
| `@|` |  |
| `@_` |  |
| `@&` |  |
| `@~` | Shuffle | Unifies `.` with a random permutation of `?`. If `?` is an integer, the permutation will never be one that has a leading `0`. Unlike `p - Permute`, this leaves no choice point.
| `@"` |  | 
| `@'` |  | 
| `` @` `` |  | 
| `@$` | To number | Unifies `.` with the number represented by the string `?`.
| `@@` |  | 
| `@#` |  |
